I'm a fourth year PhD candidate at the [MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research](https://space.mit.edu/) studying gravitational wave and black hole physics with [Scott Hughes](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/scott-hughes/). My research interests lie at the intersection of theory, computation, and data analysis.

In 2017, I graduated from Caltech with a bachelor's degree in physics. Before that, I attended the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.
