Here's a list a papers I've written on black holes and gravitational waves while at MIT:
* Learning about black hole binaries from their ringdown spectra. [Read here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05900)
* Exciting black hole modes via misaligned coalescences. [Read here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05902)
* Relativistic three-body effects in hierarchical triples. [Read here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03654)

At Caltech I also contributed to the SXS Collaboration catalog of binary black hole simulations. Read about that [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04831).
