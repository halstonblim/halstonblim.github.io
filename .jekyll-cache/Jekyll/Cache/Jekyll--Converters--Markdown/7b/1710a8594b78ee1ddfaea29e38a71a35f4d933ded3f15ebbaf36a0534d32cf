I"ø<p>Iâ€™m a fourth year PhD candidate at the <a href="https://space.mit.edu/">MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research</a> studying gravitational wave and black hole physics with <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/scott-hughes/">Scott Hughes</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of theory, computation, and data analysis.</p>

<p>Before MIT, I graduated from Caltech in 2017 (Physics BS) and before that, was at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.</p>
